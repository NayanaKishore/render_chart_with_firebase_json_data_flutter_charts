# Render the Flutter chart using JSON data stored in Firebase database

Using the Firebase REST API and HTTP client, you can retrieve the JSON data from the Firebase database and also with the help of the deserialization concept (parsing of raw JSON data to dart object model) you can convert the retrieved JSON data to chart data list for the Flutter Cartesian chart.

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. A Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in real-time to every connected client. You can use any Firebase Realtime Database URL as a REST endpoint and send requests from the HTTP client, in order to access the JSON data.
